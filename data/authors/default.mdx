#whoami

My name is Daniel, and Top StackOverflow contributor. Technologically, I'm a FullStack Consultant for JavaScript Engineering. Udemy has been my source of self-development for many years. I decided to teach by myself and contribute to this unique ecosystem.

My professional experience is from industry leaders in accounting, banking, consulting, outsourcing, and technology sectors such as Capgemini, KPMG, and IBM, entrepreneurial knowledge, and academic experience in various countries. It all combined allowed me to live in different countries; Finland, India, Netherlands, and Poland, where I'm originally from.

The variety of experiences gave me the idea that education doesn't have to be expensive, and as a self-taught developer, I want to help others.

In addition, I do have an interest in certification paths around Scrum and the Cloud, particularly in Microsoft Azure. I hold PSD I, PSM I, and PSPO I certifications from Scrum. Whereas from Azure, I'm AZ-900 (Beginner), AZ-204 (Associate, Developer), and AZ-400 (Expert, DevOps) certified. Lastly, I hold AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and GCP Associate Cloud Engineer certifications.

Commercially, I have been working on the Web since 2013, when I was 19 years old. Initially, as Webmaster & VisualBasic Developer, later as Frontend Engineer.

Technology gave me a high living standard and joy in life. Now, I want to share the knowledge I gained with you.

For in-person contact, don't hesitate to reach out to me via LinkedIn.
